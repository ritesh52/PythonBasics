        "#1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  -Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes readability and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.\n",
        "  -popularity\n",
        "    *Ease of Learning\n",
        "    *Wide Application Areas\n",
        "    *Integration and Extensibility\n",
        "    *Job Market Demand\n",
        "    *Rapid Prototyping\n",
        "\n",
        "#2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  -An interpreter in Python is a program that directly executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions at runtime. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire code into machine language before execution, an interpreter processes the code incrementally, making Python an interpreted language.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  -Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords are part of the Python syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers in your code.\n",
        "  -Here is a list of the Python keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "  'False', 'None', 'True',\"__peg_parser__ 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break','class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if','import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield'\n",
        "\n",
        "#4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  -No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Since keywords have predefined meanings and specific purposes in the language, using them as variable names would cause syntax errors and ambiguity in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  -Mutability in Python refers to an object's ability to change its state or contents after it has been created. Based on mutability, Python objects can be classified into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *Mutable Objects: Objects whose contents can be modified after creation.\n",
        "  *Immutable Objects: Objects whose contents cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  -Lists are mutable to allow dynamic changes in their content, suitable for collections that frequently change.\n",
        "  -Tuples are immutable to ensure stability, hashability, and efficient handling of fixed data. This distinction reflects Python's philosophy of providing tools tailored to specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  -The == operator checks value equality.\n",
        "  It compares the contents or values of two objects to determine if they are the same, regardless of whether the objects themselves are the same in memory.\n",
        "  -The is operator checks identity equality.\n",
        "  It determines whether two objects refer to the same memory location (i.e., whether they are the same object in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "#8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  -Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements or expressions. They perform logical operations and return a boolean value (True or False) based on the logic they evaluate.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  -Type casting (or type conversion) in Python refers to converting one data type into another. It allows programmers to explicitly or implicitly change the type of a variable to meet the requirements of the operation being performed.\n",
        "  -Types of Type Casting\n",
        "  *Implicit Type Casting.\n",
        "  *Explicit Type Casting.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  -Explicit Type Casting: Done manually by the programmer using Python's built-in functions.\n",
        "  -Implicit Type Casting: Performed automatically by Python, without programmer intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  -Conditional statements in Python are used to perform different actions or computations depending on whether a specific condition or set of conditions is True or False. They allow programs to make decisions and execute code selectively, making them essential for building dynamic and logical workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  -The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if.\" It is used when there are multiple conditions to check, and you want to execute a specific block of code as soon as one of the conditions is met. It allows for cleaner and more efficient branching compared to writing multiple separate if statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  -Both for and while loops in Python are used for iteration, allowing you to repeatedly execute a block of code. However, the main difference between the two lies in how the number of iterations is determined and the structure of the loop.\n",
        "  *for Loop\n",
        "  A for loop in Python is generally used when you know the number of iterations in advance or want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "  *while Loop\n",
        "  A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is True. The number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on when the condition becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  -A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to stop.\n",
        "  *Scenario\n",
        "  -Imagine a scenario where you are developing a system that repeatedly prompts a user to enter their password until they provide the correct one. In this case, you don't know how many attempts the user will need to make, so using a while loop makes more sense because it will keep asking for input until the condition (correct password) is met.\n"
